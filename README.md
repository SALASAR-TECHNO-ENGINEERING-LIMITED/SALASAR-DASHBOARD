## The problem

Plant heads and coordinators were tracking production, dispatch, and manpower across a sprawling, manually-updated Excel sheet — checking numbers by scrolling through dozens of columns, compiling weekly performance emails by hand, and having no single, trustworthy view of "where do things actually stand today." Small parsing mistakes or stale copies routinely led to wrong numbers reaching leadership.

This app turns that same spreadsheet into a **live, visual dashboard** — no change in how the team already enters data, but a completely different experience for everyone who needs to read it.

## What it does

- **Reads the department's existing Google Sheet automatically** — no new data-entry habit for the team, no duplicate systems to keep in sync.
- **Turns it into real-time, role-aware dashboards** for both HSD and Bhilai units — production by process stage, dispatch by client, manpower by category and shift — all filterable by date range, updating live over Socket.IO.
- **Reports on the monthly Dispatch Synopsis workbooks** — a second view on the dashboard (the **Dispatch Synopsis** toggle) reads the folder of one-workbook-per-month synopsis reports and charts department-wise dispatch against plan: monthly plan vs actual, achievement against target, day-by-day tonnage by group, cumulative pace, share by group and by in-house/job-work/buyout, per-department performance, a department-by-month grid, and the tower/pole counts.
- **Builds and sends weekly performance report emails** from inside the dashboard: drag-and-drop images, editable report text, per-client templates (Zetwerk, CNC, COW, Ramboll, and more), and scheduled sending — what used to be a manual, error-prone email-writing task becomes a five-minute job.
- **Keeps access controlled** — Google OAuth login, admin vs. manager roles, and a dedicated Process Coordinator view.

## Why it helps

| Before | With this dashboard |
|---|---|
| Manually scanning a huge spreadsheet for today's numbers | One glance at charts, filtered to any date range |
| Weekly report emails written and formatted by hand | Pre-built templates, ready to review and send in minutes |
| No visibility into shift-wise manpower or per-client dispatch trends | Dedicated charts for every breakdown that matters |
| Numbers only as current as the last time someone checked the sheet | Synced automatically on a schedule, pushed live to everyone viewing |

## Tech stack

**Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS v4, Recharts, TanStack Query
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Atlas), Socket.IO, node-cron
**Integrations:** Google OAuth, Google Drive API (spreadsheet sync), Gmail API (report sending)
**Deployed on:** Vercel (client) + Render (server)

## Getting started

```bash
# install
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install

# configure
cp server/.env.example server/.env   # fill in your own credentials

# run
cd server && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5001
cd client && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

Sign in with Google, then (as an admin) connect Google Drive from **Settings** to start syncing.

### Checking the Dispatch Synopsis figures

The monthly synopsis workbooks change layout from month to month, so their parser is checked
against the source files rather than trusted. Download the workbooks from the folder named by
`SYNOPSIS_FOLDER_ID` and run:

```bash
cd server && npm run check:synopsis -- /path/to/downloaded/workbooks
```

It parses each workbook, reconciles every department's daily columns against the cumulative,
balance and achievement-% cells the spreadsheet computes for itself, checks each day against
the sheet's own total row, and exits non-zero on any disagreement.
